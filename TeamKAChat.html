                This chat is for Team KA only. It updates live, so don't bother refreshing. You should get a notification sound as soon as the page loads as well as when someone posts a new message. If you wish to chat about other stuff, <a href="Chat.html">click here</a> to go to my main Chat applet.Try not to use offensive language here, and don't be rude or insult others. I can easily delete posts here, and if necessary, wipe the whole database.<br><br>  
                
               This is something myself and a friend of mine, Noble Mushtak (<a href="bit.ly/nhmsite">make sure to check out his site by clicking here!</a>) made in mid-2014 for fun. It turned out pretty well, so I moved it to this site, making a few edits. I then made another version of it for Team KA.<br>
                I owe you Noble, big time. Thanks! =D
